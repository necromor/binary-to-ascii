This goal of this project is to create a website that will be able to convert binary to ascii (text) and ascii to text.
Project is build under the following conditions:
  - only html, css (bootstrap and a dash of my own) and javascript in version ES2015+
  - it is developed using TDD (test driven development) - the js part 
  - tests are run under node.js using Mocha framework
  - is uses git and github in a public repository
  - it uses MIT License

To run the tests you have to have node installed, and after that run 'npm install' to install required modules.
The command to run mocha is:
  mocha --reporter=nyan script-spec.js


This is just a pet project so that I can practice my knowledge of js and try to follow good practices of creating a project from scratch to finish.
Mistakes will be made.
